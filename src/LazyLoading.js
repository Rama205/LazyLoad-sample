approach allows React to selectively update only the 
relevant parts of the real DOM when the state of an object 
changesData Binding

React adopts a one-way data-binding approach, ensuring a 
modular and efficient structure. Unidirectional data flow 
signifies that in a React app, child components are often 
nested within parent components

React's high performance is driven by its ability to update 
only the components that undergo changes, rather than 
refreshing the entire set. This results in significantly faster

React's high performance is driven by its ability to update 
only the components that undergo changes, rather than 
refreshing the entire set. This results in significantly faster 
web applications

.= Virtual DOM

React employs a Virtual DOM, which is a lightweight 
representation of the actual DOM stored in memory. This 
approach allows React to selectively update only the 
relevant parts of the real DOM when the state of an object 
changesData Binding

React adopts a one-way data-binding approach, ensuring a 
modular and efficient structure. Unidirectional data flow 
signifies that in a React app, child components are often 
nested within parent components
